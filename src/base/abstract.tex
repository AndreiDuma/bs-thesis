Coding assignments are essential in the training of computer science students. From a teacher's perspective, manually grading hundreds of submissions is a difficult, time-consuming task. Lxchecker is a platform that allows teachers to create and configure assignments. Students submit their code for grading and receive the results as soon as the automated tests are run. This saves time for teachers and gives students the chance to know in real time how well their solution behaves. In this paper, we describe the motivation behind the choices we've made and provide details about the systems's architecture and implementation.
